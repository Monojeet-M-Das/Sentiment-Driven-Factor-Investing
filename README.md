# üìà Multi-Factor Equity Strategy: Baseline vs Sentiment-Driven Model

This project implements and compares two long-short equity trading strategies:

- **Baseline Model**: Momentum + Value (Price-to-Book)
- **Sentiment Model**: Momentum + Value + Simulated Sentiment Scores

Both models are monthly-rebalanced factor portfolios constructed using a universe of U.S. equities and evaluated over the period **2019‚Äì2024**.

---

## üß† Strategy Logic

### üîπ Baseline Model
- **Momentum**: 6-month price return
- **Value**: Static Price-to-Book ratio from Yahoo Finance
- Portfolio is long the top 20% and short the bottom 20% based on the average z-score of the two factors.

### üîπ Sentiment-Driven Model
- All components of the baseline model
- Simulated sentiment scores per stock per month (as proxy for real FinBERT pipeline)
- Scores range from -1 to 1, based on sentiment polarity

## üìä Performance Summary (2019‚Äì2024)

| Model       | Annual Return | Volatility | Sharpe |
|-------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Sentiment   | -3.36%        | 7.45%      | -0.45  |
| Baseline    | -3.26%        | 11.11%     | -0.29  |

> Both models underperformed the S&P 500 over the period, reflecting their academic, unoptimized nature.

| `Baseline_Model1.py`         | Momentum + Value factor model                   |
| `Simulated_Sentiment_Model1.py` | Baseline + simulated sentiment factor model      |
| `comparison_script.py`       | Visualization of cumulative returns for both models side-by-side |

## üîß Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`
- `yfinance` for real price and P/B data
- `logging` for clean traceability
- Simulated sentiment generation with NumPy (replaceable with FinBERT)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **No transaction cost modeling**
- **No walk-forward validation or hyperparameter tuning**
- **Static P/B ratios** (not time-series)
- Sentiment scores are **simulated**, not derived from actual headlines in this version

---

## üìå Future Improvements

- Replace simulated sentiment with real FinBERT-based headline sentiment  
- Integrate walk-forward portfolio validation  
- Add turnover constraint and transaction cost model  
- Dynamic valuation metrics (e.g., forward P/E, EV/EBITDA)

## üìö Educational Use

This project is meant for **educational and research purposes** to demonstrate factor-based modeling, not for live trading. Despite underperformance, it highlights:
- Strategy design and backtesting workflow  
- Factor combination and z-scoring  
- Benchmarking and visualization
